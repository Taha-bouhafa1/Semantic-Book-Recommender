# 📚 Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs

This project is a **semantic book recommendation system** powered by **sentence-transformer embeddings**, **LangChain**, and an interactive **Gradio** UI. It allows users to receive personalized book recommendations based on natural language queries, category filters, and emotional tones extracted from book descriptions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search** — Uses MiniLM sentence embeddings to retrieve books similar to user prompts.
- 🏷️ **Category Filtering** — Classifies books into categories like Fiction, Biography, etc.
- 🎭 **Emotional Sorting** — Ranks books based on emotions (joy, sadness, fear, etc.).
- 🌐 **Gradio UI** — Clean user interface for querying and browsing results visually.

## 🧠 Main Components

| File                       | Description                                                       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dashboard_gradio.py`      | Main Python app with Gradio interface and book retrieval logic.  |
| `books_with_emotions.csv`  | Final dataset with cleaned metadata, category, and emotion scores.|
| `tagged_description.txt`   | Preprocessed book descriptions with `isbn13` used for vector DB.  |
| `data-exploration.ipynb`   | Initial data cleaning and preprocessing steps.                    |
| `text_classification.ipynb`| Assigns simple categories using LLM-based classification.         |
| `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` | Uses a transformer model to extract emotion scores per book.      |
| `vector-search (1).ipynb`  | Manual test of vector search using LangChain + Chroma.            |

## 💻 Running the App

### 1. Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install requirements:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install gradio langchain-community langchain-chroma sentence-transformers pandas numpy python-dotenv
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
python dashboard_gradio.py
```

You’ll see something like:

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Load and Embed Descriptions**  
  Book descriptions are loaded from `tagged_description.txt`, split into chunks, and embedded using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

- **Vector DB Creation**  
  Descriptions are embedded and stored using Chroma, a vector database backed by LangChain.

- **Query Matching**  
  User input is also embedded and used to retrieve the most similar book chunks.

- **Filtering & Sorting**  
  Retrieved books are filtered by category and optionally sorted based on emotional tone: joy, sadness, anger, fear, or surprise.

- **Display in UI**  
  Gradio renders the final recommendations with thumbnails, titles, and summaries.

## 📌 Dataset

This project uses the Kaggle dataset:

📚 **[7k Books with Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata)**  
It includes book titles, authors, descriptions, thumbnails, and category labels.
